# Runner Coin

This is our project title for final assigment at "Workshop Membuat Game Edukasi dengan Unity" or "Workshop on Making Educational Games with Unity"
Actually this is supposed to have a gameplay like one of the stages in "tales runner" where the player run and then opens the door according to the answers to the math questions that appear on the screen,
But due to time constraints for task submission, the following results are what we can present for assessment to the evaluator

The purpose of this game is really simple, collect all of the coin that already spreaded at the field and avoid the obstacles.
but because this is the endless runner game , so run and collect all coin until you die haha (just joking)

## Getting started
The thing that you only can do in this game is just 4 things:
1. move left and right
2. jump
3. restart the game
4. and exit from this game 


## the things that can be developed
1. of course the gameplay : right now, its a very boring game
2. stage and obstacles : because very boring
3. assets usage : maybe we will get copyright infringement for carelessly using assets
